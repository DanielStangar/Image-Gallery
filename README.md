40 photographs of my newly born son with a lightbox

This was a personal project to practice CSS Grid (at the end I used only very little of it), working with photographs of various sizes and employing the script of Lightbox 2 created by Lokesh Dhakar - https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/#getting-started.
